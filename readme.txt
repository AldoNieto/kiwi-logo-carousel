== Installation ==

<ul>
<li>Install your plugin by uploading it in your Wordpress site or install it directly from the Wordpress Plugin Browser.</li>
<li>Upload your logos to the Custom Post Type and add them to a carousel (category)</li>
<li>Copy the shortcode in your Wordpress site. No id specified will return all logos. You can also use the id 'default' for returning all logos. If you want to display a single carousel category, use the slug as the id. The shortcode looks like this <code>[logo-carousel id=default]</code></li>
</ul>

<p>NOTE: You can't use a carousel category with a slug called 'default'.</p>

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
